This application spams left mouse clicks when the left mouse button is being held, wherever the cursor is currently at. It will only listen to the left button when turned on (F9 key turns on/off by default, playing a beep when pressed).

The purpose for this application is automatizing click-based tasks on games, like gaming mouses' macros. It will work with a frequency set by the user, so it fits to the speed needs (Note: the base frequency is 10ms). Some games might catch key presses, not allowing an application in the background to work with these events, that's why a polling algorithm is being used instead of events.

The settings window shows a random title to avoid the application being black listed, and thus preventing the user from being banned. This window may be closed at any time, keeping the script running in the background. Pressing F10 key is required to terminate the script (it will also delete the GUI, if it still exists).
